You will be given 3 or more images.

Your task is to:
1. Detect if **each image** contains a **valid human face**.
2. If **any image** does NOT contain a face, return a JSON that only reports which images are missing faces.
3. If **all images** contain a valid face, then:
   - Compare the faces to check if they belong to the **same person**.
   - Calculate a confidence score.
   - Identify which image(s) are mismatched, if any.
4. there is also an id of the person in this so i will need you to detect the face from the id and check wehter the face from the uploaded images is the same as the face from the id 
this must be precise and 100 percent accurate consider some images might be blur and low light so use some image processing i them to 

### Step 1: Face Detection

If any face is missing, return:
{
  "same_person": false,
  "id_match":"",
  "match_confidence": 0.0,
  "mismatched_images": [],
  "face_not_detected": ["imageX", "imageY"]
}

### Step 2: Face Comparison

If all faces are detected, return:
{
  "same_person": true or false,
  "id_match":"",
  "match_confidence": float (0 to 1),
  "mismatched_images": ["imageX", "imageY"],
  "face_not_detected": []
}

### Additional Instructions:
- Use image labels: image1, image2, image3, ..., imageN
- Always return only a valid JSON object â€” no extra text, formatting, or markdown.
- The output must be only a JSON component starting from { and ending with }.
